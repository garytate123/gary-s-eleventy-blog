## **Hello, I'm Gary!** [\#](https://garytateblog.netlify.app/posts/firstpost/#hello%2C-i'm-gary!)

Even though this blog will be focused on my learning during my time on the JAMStack Bootcamp with The Coders Guild, I would like to start by introducing myself.

I'm just over the grand age of 40 and I'm still crazy about learning as much as I can about web development. I'm fairly new to coding but so far, I'm loving the challenge.



### Work [\#](https://garytateblog.netlify.app/posts/firstpost/#work)

I've not always been a web developer, in fact for the past 4 years I've been a self-employed events co-ordinator and previous to that, I was a youth worker for over 16 years. I have worked in many different settings and believe that I have gained and developed many skills that would benefit must companies when working in teams, with clients and remotely on my own.



### Interests and Passions [\#](https://garytateblog.netlify.app/posts/firstpost/#interests-and-passions)

I know it's a bit cliche but I love developing and creating websites. From the planning stage to the design stage to the development stage, I enjoy the full process of creating the website.

I'm a big Leeds United fan and will try and watch as many games as possible. I also love watching a good film and get really get into a good tv series. Some of my favourite series have been Lost and Breaking Bad.
