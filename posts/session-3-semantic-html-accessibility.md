Make the table above in HTML and style with CSS and embed your solution in a blog post.

1. The table width should fill any container it is put in
2. The noise image is on the table body only not the head or foot
3. The two fonts are Rock Salt and Helvetica Neu
4. Here is that lovely leopard skin image
5. There is a gradient fill on the header and footer - rgba(0,0,0,0.1), rgba(0,0,0,0.5)

Here are those delicious colours\
#800080 (Border)\
#ff33cc (background on rows 1, 3, 5, and 7)\
#e495e4 (background on rows 2, 4, 6, and 8)
