## **Hello, I'm Gary!**

Eventhough this blog will be fcoused on my learning during my time on the JAMStack Bootcamp with The Coders Guild, I would like to start off my intrducing myself.

### Work

I've always been a web developer, infact for the pas 4 years I've been a self employed events co-ordinator and previouseto that, I was a youth worker for over 16 years.  I have worked in many different settings and belive that I have gained and developed many skills that would benifit must ompanies when working in teams, with clients and remotley on my own. 

### Interests and Passions

I know it's a bit cliche but I love developing and creating websites. From the planning stage to the design stage to the development stage, I enjoy the full process of creating the website. 

I'm a big Leeds United fan and will try and watch as many games as possible. I also love watching a good film and get really get into a good tv series. Some of my favorite series have been Lost and Breaking Bad.
