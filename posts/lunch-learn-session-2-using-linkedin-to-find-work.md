These are my notes taken from the LinkedIn Lunch and Learn session.



**Building a good profile**

* Professional profile photo, don't use family or holiday photos.
* Your profile is your CV - it needs to match your cv with dates ect
* Location matters and will help recruiters find you
* Have an updated about me section
* Have the correct name of the employer on your work history to get the logo
* Ask for a recommendation for people you know and have worked with



**Skills**

* Add key skills - recruiters will search for the skills



**Job Section**

* Job search - try searching by using one word.
* At the bottom of the search - find create alert for that job search



**Groups**

* Join relevant groups, it's a great way to connect and hear about new opportunities
* Work menu > groups
* Find groups based on job searches



**Networking and connections**

* Don't connect with people - instead, Fellow them.
* Be involved - comment on other peoples posts - like and share
* Find companies that you want to work for and that you are interested in - follow them
