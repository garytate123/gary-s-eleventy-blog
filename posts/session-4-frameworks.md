Create a HTML page using bootstrap to advertise your favourite band.

* The page should include a header, hero, main content, sidebar and footer.
* The header should contain the band logo.
* The hero will contain a carousel with at least 3 images of the band.
* The main content will contain some information about the band and an embedded youtube video.
* The sidebar will contain (fake) information about upcoming tour dates.
* The footer will contain a copyright symbol and this year.

  You can visit my band website[ here](https://garytate123.github.io/band-website/)

1. Clone a copy of the framework example and get it running localy 
2. Add bootstrap CSS and JS to it. (At that point nothing will look/act differently.) 3. Add a Carousel component in the main section with some images.
3. Update the layout to use bootstrap layout classes.

   The result of the tasks can be found [here](https://garytate123.github.io/bootstrap4-project/)
