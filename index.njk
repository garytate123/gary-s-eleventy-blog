      <h4>Hi, I'm Gary Tate...</h4>
      <p>
        I'm currently learning how to be a JAMSTack developer with The Coder Guild.</p>

      <p>Even though this blog will be focused on my learning during my time on the JAMStack Bootcamp with The Coders Guild, I would like to start by introducing myself. I'm just over the grand age of 40 and I'm still crazy about learning as much as I can about web development. I'm fairly new to coding but so far, I'm loving the challenge.</p>
      <p>This blog will be used to evidence my completed tasks and the extra learning that I will undertake throughout the course.
      </p>
